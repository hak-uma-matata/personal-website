                    I'm a highly motivated undergraduate student studying <span className = "blue">computer science</span> at the <span className = "blue">Georgia Institute of Technology </span>
                    with concentrations in <span className = "blue">Systems and Architecture</span> and <span className = "blue">Information Internetworks</span>.

                    I go the extra mile to learn, from self studying all my APs to trying a new course on Khan Academy every summer. I
                    devote all my energy into what I am doing and love collaborating with people, constantly learning, and experiencing something new everyday!

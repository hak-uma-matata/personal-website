                    I wrote my first "app" on Khan Academy when I was in sixth grade in ProcessingJS before moving onto  <span className = "blue">computer science</span> at the <span className = "blue">Georgia Institute of Technology</span>.
                    I am highly motivated and always put in the extra mile regardless of what I am doing.

                    I have experience with <span className = "blue">website development</span>, and <span className = "blue">software engineering</span>. I love learning new things and seeing what life has in store for me next.
